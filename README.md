## Nice to meet you! ðŸ¦œ
My name is Marcel Huber, and I am currently enrolled in the B.Sc. program for Artificial Intelligence (AI) at [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/) in Linz, Austria.

I have a keen interest in exploring various branches of AI, but I find Image Generation particularly thrilling, especially when it comes to studying Diffusion models and GANs in detail. I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to analyze the current capabilities and limitations of GANs in the medical sector, specifically with OCT images as part of my bachelor's thesis. My work is primarily focused on extracting meaningful latent directions from trained models, which is an exciting endeavor.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Innovative projects in the field of Artificial Intelligence, exploring the potential of deep learning and computer vision.
- Furthermore, I'm collaborating on a research project that explores the intersection of AI and healthcare. Specifically, we are investigating the application of deep learning models in medical image analysis and diagnosis. By training models on large datasets of medical images, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection, enabling early intervention and better patient outcomes.
- Finally, during this summer, I've dedicated myself to immersing deeply into the latest literature on image synthesis. It's an exhilarating journey where I'm delving into the cutting-edge research and techniques in this field. My aim is not only to gain a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles but also to take on the challenge of implementing these architectures from scratch. By doing so, I seek to strengthen my grasp of the underlying concepts and develop a hands-on intuition for image synthesis. Through this ambitious endeavor, I aspire to contribute to the advancement of this exciting domain and explore the creative possibilities that lie within it.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Advanced techniques in music processing and image synthesis to enhance my AI skillset.
- Another area of my current learning journey is computer vision, where I'm focusing on deep learning techniques for object detection, image segmentation, and visual recognition. I'm eager to develop models that can accurately perceive and interpret visual information, opening doors to applications in autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and medical imaging.
- Additionally, I'm continuously sharpening my skills in cloud computing and distributed systems, as they play a crucial role in scaling AI applications and handling large-scale data processing. Understanding how to deploy and manage AI systems in cloud environments allows for efficient computation, collaboration, and scalability.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to:
- Join open-source AI projects where I can contribute my expertise in AI and collaborate with other passionate developers and researchers.
- Work with a diverse team on challenging problems in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, or reinforcement learning.
- Collaborate on projects that have a positive societal impact, such as those related to healthcare, education, or environmental sustainability.
- Engage in knowledge sharing and brainstorming sessions with fellow contributors to foster innovative ideas and approaches.
- Learn from experienced developers and researchers in the open-source community and expand my understanding of AI techniques and best practices.
- Contribute to projects that prioritize inclusivity, diversity, and ethical considerations in AI development.
- Explore interdisciplinary collaborations that integrate AI with other fields such as robotics, biology, or social sciences.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for:
- Collaborators who are passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI and are interested in working on cutting-edge research projects.
- Opportunities to contribute to open-source AI projects and collaborate with like-minded developers and researchers.
- Insightful discussions and knowledge exchange with fellow AI enthusiasts to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends.
- Interesting projects or challenges that require a creative and analytical approach to problem-solving in the realm of AI.
- Workshops, conferences, or training programs focused on AI advancements, model optimization, and interpretability techniques.
- Opportunities to apply AI in domains such as healthcare, finance, or environmental sustainability to make a positive impact on society.
